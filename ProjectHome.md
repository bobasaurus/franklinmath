## Franklin Math is now available! ##

**Franklin Math** is a small open source computer algebra system (aka fancy calculator), designed to be fast and handy for quick calculations.  It handles some symbolic algebra and manipulation, as well as high-precision numeric calculations.  The built-in functions cover several fields of mathematics, and allow for function plotting.

I have tested the installer on Windows XP without any issues.  On Linux, you may have to be logged in as a root/administrator to have shortcuts created properly.  On a Mac, the installer (generated with IzPack) does not support shortcut creation yet, so you will have to make your own (be sure to set the working directory to Franklin Math's install path).
