= Franklin Math Information =

I decided to create Franklin Math in November, 2007.  As a dual major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, I have always loved using computers to advance the field of mathematics.  Influenced by the amazing capabilities of commercial CAS programs, I decided to make a math language of my own.  And thus, Franklin Math was born.
